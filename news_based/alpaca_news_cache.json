Whether or not they lead in tech, they've proven they can lead in culture.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some altcoins may benefit from this potential rotation, others might not experience the same momentum. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aurelie Barthere</strong>, Principal Research Analyst at <strong>Nansen</strong>, pointed out, &#8220;XRP, for instance, previously benefited from speculative momentum tied to potential inclusion in FX reserves, a tailwind that is no longer present, unlike Bitcoin.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/05/45571765/kraken-to-launch-247-tokenized-stock-trading-for-global-users-via-solana\">Kraken To Launch 24/7 Tokenized Stock Trading For Global Users Via Solana</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>She emphasized the importance of clear catalysts for altcoins to drive performance in the current market environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kelghe D&#8217;Cruz</strong>, CEO of <strong>Pairs</strong>, highlighted the cyclical nature of the crypto market, stating, &#8220;The typical market cycle tends to follow a well-known pattern: Bitcoin runs up first, its dominance plateaus, and then altcoins begin to move.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He expressed optimism about Dogecoin&#8217;s future, mentioning the upcoming launch of DogeOS as a potential transformative initiative for the token.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not all experts are equally optimistic about all altcoins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eneko Kn\u00f6rr</strong>, CEO of <strong>Stabolut</strong>, expressed skepticism about meme coins, stating, &#8220;Retail might chase them for hype cycles, but I believe other altcoins will offer stronger fundamentals and better long-term upside.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He acknowledged that XRP still has a defined use case and loyal community, which might help it maintain relevance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Joe Z</strong>, Co-founder of <strong>DeAgentAI</strong>, emphasized the potential for capital rotation into altcoins, noting, &#8220;If Bitcoin maintains its position above $110,000, we could see strong allocations across OG altcoins like XRP, DOGE, and SHIB, especially among retail investors seeking higher returns than what BTC can provide in the short term.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also highlighted technological developments like Shibarium as potential catalysts for SHIB&#8217;s upward price momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/05/45570094/anthony-scaramucci-says-thin-supply-is-driving-bitcoin-to-new-all-time-highs\">Anthony Scaramucci Says Thin Supply Is Driving Bitcoin To New All-Time Highs</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ",

That often precedes corrective pullbacks,\" he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bitfinex </strong>analysts noted the breakout above $109,500 was driven by \"clean spot demand, ETF inflows, and a macro backdrop that favors risk-on assets.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They added that funding rates remain stable and open interest is rising in line with price\u2014hallmarks of a structurally sound rally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/05/45543096/why-donald-trump-including-cardano-in-the-crypto-reserve-suprised-even-the-founder-nice-to-see-progress\">Why Donald Trump Including Cardano In The Crypto Reserve Surprised Even The Founder: &#8216;Nice To See Progress&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s Next: </strong>Yet, not all analysts are focused on short-term price moves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Carvalho</strong>, CEO of <strong>Naoris Protocol</strong>, warned that quantum computing is a \"credible existential threat\" to Bitcoin's long-term integrity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"There are over 100 quantum machines operational globally. With Shor's algorithm, they could break Bitcoin's cryptography,\" he said, referencing the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm that secures the majority of BTC. \"Roughly 30% of Bitcoin sits in wallets vulnerable to quantum attacks.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carvalho noted that while major institutions like <strong>BlackRock </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BLK#NYSE\">BLK</a>) and agencies such as the NSA are preparing for a quantum-secure future, \"investors remain overconfident in the current cryptographic defenses.\" </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added, \"If even one high-profile wallet is compromised, trust in the system could collapse overnight.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Roshan Robert</strong>, U.S. CEO of <strong>OKX</strong>, emphasized the broader context: \"Bitcoin's rise isn't just speculative. It reflects how capital preservation is being redefined across institutions and sovereigns.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With price targets between $114,000 and $125,000 being flagged by several analysts as the next resistance zones, the immediate focus remains on ETF flows and macro data, including U.S. labor figures and central bank remarks later this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/25/05/45534496/altcoin-rotation-is-coming-expert-says-will-eth-xrp-dogecoin-benefit\">Altcoin Rotation Is Coming, Expert Says: Will ETH, XRP, Dogecoin Benefit?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ",

Today, the values would be much higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the values of Reschenthaler's former BTC, SOL and XRP stakes based on the prices at the time of writing listed below:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>XRP</strong>, <strong>$2.37</strong>: $14,392.70 to $15,870.54</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>SOL, </strong> <strong>$180.81</strong>: $11,767.11 to $12,794.12</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>BTC, $109,730.02</strong>: $16,558.26 to $17,611.67</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reschenthaler may not have made more by holding his Solana until now and likely would have made only a slightly larger profit or loss by holding XRP until today. However, the real change in value comes with Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The congressman would be up on his Bitcoin trade had he held until today, while selling in April likely meant he lost money on his December trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin hit all-time highs of $111,970.17 on May 22 and many analysts and experts see the leading cryptocurrency going higher by the end of 2025 and into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it's unclear why Reschenthaler sold after such a short time holding the cryptocurrency, it could be an important lesson in the volatility of cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate from month to month and sometimes it takes more than four or five months to see crypto return to new highs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/25/01/42860759/10-best-stock-traders-in-congress-in-2024-where-do-nancy-pelosi-pete-sessions-susan-collins-marjorie-taylor-greene-rank\"><strong>Top 10 Stock Traders In Congress For 2024: How Nancy Pelosi, Pete Sessions, Susan Collins, Marjorie Taylor Greene Rank</strong></a></li>\n</ul>    ",

But historically, golden crosses are often followed by 10-15% pullbacks.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He referenced similar setups in 2019, 2020, and 2021, when Bitcoin dipped soon after golden crosses, noting that a 10% retrace would bring BTC back near $100,000, while 15% would test $95,000, both near key moving averages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While acknowledging his incorrect prediction about a similar pattern in late 2023, Cowen emphasizes the importance of learning from both successful and unsuccessful forecasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If there is a pullback after this golden cross, it would be a fairly normal pullback,&#8221; he explained, noting that a 10% correction would bring Bitcoin back to approximately $100,000, while a 15% drop would test the 50-day and 200-day moving averages around $95,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: Cowen sees the current window, late May to early June, as a historically strong period for Bitcoin, typically followed by Q3 softness, as seen in both 2023 and 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rising macro risks, such as a 10-year treasury yield at 4.6%, approaching 5%, and the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s stagnation, could weigh on broader risk sentiment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Cowen remains long-term bullish, particularly on Bitcoin's outperformance versus <strong>Ethereum</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/eth/usd\">ETH</a>) and <strong>XRP</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/xrp/usd\">XRP</a>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"Bitcoin gives you exposure to the upside, while minimizing downside risk,\" he said, highlighting its rising market dominance even during consolidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/05/45568207/bitcoin-to-120000-next-heres-what-technical-analysis-says\">Bitcoin To $120,000 Next? Here&#8217;s What Technical Analysis Says</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What's Next: </strong>While a golden cross pullback could pressure BTC near-term, Cowen expects it to be short-lived, predicting a renewed push higher into Q4. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For investors seeking stability in the face of volatility, Bitcoin remains the preferred asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/05/45561695/bitcoin-shatters-110000-xrp-dogecoin-ethereum-surge-bulls-emerge-victorious-trader-concludes\">Bitcoin Shatters $110,000, XRP, Dogecoin, Ethereum Surge: &#8216;Bulls Emerge Victorious,&#8217; Trader Concludes</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>    ",

Over the past week, DOGE has jumped 3.68%, riding a wave of optimism. Dogecoin surge has stalled as traders eye inflation data and X Money, while mining platforms fuel adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DOGE dipped by 2.5% in the first half of Tuesday as traders now move to lock in profits ahead of Friday's US Core PCE Inflation Data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/go/plus-500-crypto-in-content\">Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses</a></strong><strong> \u2014 no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>New to trading crypto?<a href=\"http://coinbase-consumer.sjv.io/m5ALXy\"><strong> Get up to $400 in rewards for successfully completing short educational courses and placing your first qualifying trade</strong></a> on Coinbase.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Elon Musk's latest announcement has rekindled optimism in the community. He confirmed through a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the platform's long-awaited payments service, X Money, is entering beta soon. The initial rollout will be available to a small group of users before a wider release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He emphasized that, given the involvement of users' savings, the rollout will be handled with great caution. While Dogecoin wasn't mentioned, Musk's history of supporting the token has renewed speculation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pi Network (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/\">PI</a>), which sells plug-and-play mining devices, claims users are now earning over $36,900 daily through their XY miners, now configured to mine DOGE.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BCC Mining, a platform based in the UK, launched a mobile app that offers free cloud mining for cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. By lowering the barriers to entry, the app encourages wider participation while highlighting the long-term potential of coins such as Dogecoin, Ripple (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/xrp/usd\">XRP</a>), and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogecoin co-founder, Billy Markus, known as Shibetoshi Nakamoto on X, laughed off Bitcoin's $250,000 price forecast, poking fun at the market hype. He mocked the trend of sensational headlines highlighting how often unknown individuals make bold claims about Bitcoin hitting $250,000 within the year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogecoin is consolidating near a critical resistance zone around $0.24 and $0.25. Through May 2025, DOGE has traded within a tight range of $0.21 and $0.26. It recently tested the $0.25 level, which has acted both as support and resistance over the past 6 months. The zone has seen multiple rejections in the past, but current price action indicates a potential breakout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dogecoin has remained confined between $0.21 and $0.25, a range framed by the 200-day exponential moving average. The technical outlook is bullish, as the price is showing signs of breaking out of a descending triangle pattern that formed since the rally to $0.26 earlier this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network activity supports the optimism, with new addresses up 102%, active addresses rising 111%, and zero-balance addresses increasing 155%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Jake Wujastyk has identified a strong trading opportunity targeting $0.45, roughly a 100% gain from the recent lows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to TradingView, Dogecoin's consolidation within 4 to 5 cents is well defined. Should the 200-day EMA fail to hold, the next key support is the psychological level of $0.20. A drop below $0.14 would indicate a strong bearish shift.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Opportunities:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Grow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto \u2013 <a href=\"https://info.irafinancial.com/lp/irafi-crypto/?utm_source=benzinga.com&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=y2\"><strong>unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account</strong></a>.</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trade, earn, and grow your crypto portfolio with Crypto.com \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/go/crypto-com-signup-bonus\"><strong>plus receive up to $500 worth of rewards in the most popular tokens if you're a new customer</strong></a>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Image: Shutterstock</strong></em></p>    ",

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Bitcoin ETF Experts On Past, Present And Future Of Sector \u2014 Why US Buying BTC Could Be 'Monumental Moment' <p>According to several experts in the sector, Bitcoin ETFs and cryptocurrency-related ETFs have made significant progress since launching in January 2024 <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/currency-etfs/25/01/42971053/bitcoin-etfs-enter-2025-after-massive-first-year\">and setting inflow records</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here's what three Bitcoin-ETF experts had to say about the sector&#8217;s growth, why people are choosing Bitcoin ETFs, what the U.S. buying <strong>Bitcoin</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/btc/usd\">BTC</a>) could mean for demand and validation, and what comes next for cryptocurrency ETFs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beating Expectations: </strong>The launch of Bitcoin ETFs has been an &#8220;amazing journey&#8221; that could be &#8220;just beginning,&#8221; <strong>WisdomTree </strong>Global Head of Research <strong>Chris Gannatti </strong>said at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-tme4GtysQ\">Benzinga's recent ETF event.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"At WisdomTree, we've been amazed to watch the appetite, the adoption,\" Gannatti said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gannatti said it's clear there was pent-up demand for Bitcoin ETFs and everyone has now seen \"incredible growth.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WisdomTree was one of the first companies with a Bitcoin ETF with the<strong> WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund</strong> (BATS:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BTCW#BATS\">BTCW</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitwise Asset Management Head of Research <strong>Ryan Rasmussen</strong> echoed the early success of Bitcoin ETFs with his company behind the <strong>Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust</strong> (NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/BITB#NYSE\">BITB</a>) and several other crypto-related ETFs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The adoption and performance of Bitcoin ETFs since they launched in the US since last January is just incredible,\" Rasmussen said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rasmussen said Bitcoin ETFs broke the one-year record for inflows and continue to see strong demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We're extremely excited about it. Just getting started.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the launch of the initial batch of Bitcoin ETFs came other funds like the<strong> Innovator Uncapped Bitcoin 20 Floor ETF </strong>(BATS:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QBF#BATS\">QBF</a>), which offers limited downside for investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Innovator </strong>Director of Product Strategy <strong>Andrew Nelson</strong> said the initial growth of Bitcoin ETFs is what spurred the company launching a crypto ETF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"There's room for everybody,\" Nelson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nelson said Innovator's fund creates additional investment opportunities for investors and another tool in their tool kit when looking for exposure to Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Also: <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/25/04/45018551/senator-on-digital-assets-committee-buys-more-bitcoin-etf-shares-2025-is-the-year-for-digital-assets\">Senator On Digital Assets Committee Buys More Bitcoin ETF Shares: &#8216;2025 Is The Year For Digital Assets&#8217;</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why Bitcoin ETFs?: </strong>When asked why there's room for Bitcoin ETFs alongside investing directly in Bitcoin, the expert panel didn't flinch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nelson said Bitcoin ETFs like the one from Innovator provide \"unique exposure\" for investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summarizing his company's ETF in three sentences, he said it's, \"Bitcoin, 20% max loss, and no cap.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Innovator fund offers an uncapped upside while providing a 20% max loss each quarter for investors. Nelson said this is not something you can engineer on your own just by holding Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rasmussen echoed this sentiment saying there are different things ETFs can do like derivatives and options along with getting access to \"institutional grade custody\" of Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Bitcoin ETFs, there's less risk for asset managers than worrying about self-custody and other aspects for clients, Rasmussen added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Countries and Companies Adding Bitcoin:</strong> Another key growth topic for Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs could be the stockpiling of the leading cryptocurrency by countries and companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gannatti said that some see the degree of success <strong>Michael Saylor</strong> has had with <strong>Strategy Inc </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSTR#NASDAQ\">MSTR</a>) buying Bitcoin and they want to follow it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"People who have achieved great success get great attention,\" Gannatti said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gannatti also said the US being more crypto-friendly isn't a done deal, but things are changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"The current administration is pushing the ball down the field in a positive direction.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without giving a price prediction, Gannatti said if the only goal is to get the price of Bitcoin to go up fast, the U.S. buying Bitcoin could be the quickest way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rasmussen highlighted the sector&#8217;s change. The fact that a person predicting some of the things that happened five years ago would have been laughed at and called crazy, he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I think it's crazy that we're seeing corporations and governments buy Bitcoin, not in a bad way,\" Rasmussen said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rasmussen referenced how <strong>GameStop </strong>(NYSE:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GME#NYSE\">GME</a>) recently bought Bitcoin. More companies are saying they're adding the cryptocurrency to hedge against national debt, inflation, and geopolitical concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I still think we're in the early stages of seeing mass adoption by governments and corporations.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rasmussen added that, \"no government wants to be the last mover when it comes to this.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pension funds that have yet to invest in Bitcoin say they&#8217;d feel comfortable adding cryptocurrency to their portfolios if the U.S. purchases Bitcoin, the panelist added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"I think that is one of those monumental moments,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More demand from countries and corporations could lead the price of Bitcoin higher, Nelson said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nelson said the idea is that high demand drives prices higher in a supply-constrained environment. The U.S. buying Bitcoin could be a positive action for the sector. Yet, Nelson added, it might not be the same initial demand that happened when Bitcoin ETFs launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We think it's a positive for the space.\"</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What's Next:</strong> Bitwise predicts Bitcoin will hit $200,000 by the end of 2025 and $1 million by 2029. Rasmussen said these are predictions and not investment advice but show confidence in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going forward, the company is also launching more ETFs in the cryptocurrency space. This includes covered call income strategy funds around public crypto-companies like Strategy, <strong>MARA Holdings</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MARA#NASDAQ\">MARA</a>) and <strong>Coinbase Global </strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/COIN#NASDAQ\">COIN</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\"We're spending a lot of time thinking about what products do investors want access to,\" Rasmussen said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Innovator has just one current cryptocurrency ETF \u2014 QBF. However, the company is closely monitoring the space and the options market to see where the demand is, Nelson said, adding, \"We're looking at Ethereum of course, because of its already approved nature.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Innvoator also monitors <strong>Solana</strong> (CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/sol/usd\">SOL</a>) and <strong>XRP</strong> CRYPTO:XRP). </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next: </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/etfs/new-etfs/25/02/43599972/new-bitcoin-etf-limits-losses-to-20-offers-risk-controlled-exposure\">New Bitcoin ETF Limits Losses To 20%, Offers Risk-Controlled Exposure</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n <iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Crypto Panel - Virtual ETF Event\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozqSFOpMooE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image: Shutterstock</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>    ",

Since then, the regulatory climate under President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has become more crypto\u2011friendly, prompting new filings such as a combined Bitcoin\u2011Ether ETF.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ripple's legal victory against the SEC, including a $50 million settlement in March 2025 (despite a temporary rejection of a joint motion in May), has further fueled optimism for U.S. XRP ETFs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research by <strong>Kaiko </strong>indicates XRP has more ETF filings than other altcoins like Solana, <strong>Dogecoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/doge/usd\">DOGE</a>), and <strong>Litecoin </strong>(CRYPTO: <a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/quote/ltc/usd\">LTC</a>), reflecting strong market interest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <strong>Grayscale</strong>'s XRP Trust (XRX) offers indirect XRP exposure in the U.S., and there is speculation that it may convert to an ETF if regulatory hurdles clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong> <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/crypto/cryptocurrency/25/06/45962262/jpmorgan-files-trademark-jpmd-crypto-trading-digital-asset-services\">Dimon Called Crypto A &#8216;Ponzi Scheme&#8217;\u2014Now JPMorgan Is Building JPMD To Trade It</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Photo: Shutterstock</em></p>    ",
